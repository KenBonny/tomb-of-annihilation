# the beginning

gather in inn
meet lady Syndra Sylvane
she asks us to investigate the strange death curse that has been plaguing the world
first step is to chart the island of Chult
go to Chult by boat because the lady is in bad health
had 80 days to live

encounter thugs on the way to the docks
they killed guardsmen
defeat them, kill 3, one gets away
get reward for bringing the corpses to guard station and letting them know what happend to their patrol
