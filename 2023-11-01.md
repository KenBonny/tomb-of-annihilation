# The interrogation

We agreed to pay the resqued orcs 2GP a day for their services
We wake the captured guard and learn his name is Gen and he is a member of the Zentharim, who we know is a shady organisation that deals in arms, drugs and slaves
We gave a street dog some meat and befriended her, we gave her the name Yuna ðŸ’˜
we hide the body in a vat of wine and use a wheelbarrow to transport it to the residence of Kwayothe

When we arrive early in the morning at Kwayothe's mansion, the guards let James and Filrene inside
They present the barrel to Kwayothe and her husband
A guard determines that the dead man is indeed a member of the Zentharim
We receive 88 gold (in the form of a gem), a basket of soaps and oils and a reminder of the job we need to do for the husband


# the alley
On the way to the inn, we notice a 3 chultans in an alleyway
James notices that they are street urchins and hooligans, but cannot understand what they are talking about
we pass them and their leader starts throwing insults in chultan at the party
mostly is directed at James as he is a half-orc
the party ignores them, BingBong replies with some rude gestures and Yuna growls
we pass them and they follow us
James is prepared for an attack
Filrene creates dancing lights in the shapes of an L on their foreheads
on the other side, 2 more thugs await us
Filrene lets the dancing lights explode after warning us
in the confusion, James grabs the nearest thug in a chokehold
The guy shouts to release him 
The leader shouts to attack them
Filrene grows impatient and shoots the thug James is holding through the head, barely missing James and deafening him in the process
The whole neighbourhood rushes outside after hearing the gunshot
The leader starts whipping up the crowd
Luckily, Katisha can calm them down by threating with the name of Pockmarked Po and Allistar Bol
James was ready to beat back the crowd with his stick (hidden sword)
Filrene stood ready to shoot the leader in the face
After Katisha calmed them down further, we did not have to fend off a mob
A few of the mob pointed to Filrene and her pistols and shouted Gondian (Gond: god of tinkerers and engineers)

# brunch
after that, we went back to the inn and had a good nights rest
In the morning, the full party, guides and others are gathered for an elaborate brunch
James talks with Azaka and Volo about their favourite and disliked foods when he finds a fishbone in his nicely cooked fish, he proceeds to send the dish back and receives a plate of bangers and mash. Volo started going on and on about some exotic food he ate
Tissaia asks what James and co were up to last night, James said that they tied up some loose ends for Kwayothe. Ellis distracted Tissaia with encountering Yuna

during dessert, a woman named Inete wished to speak with us.
Johan, Tissaia, Tsavi and Elina went to talk to the woman
The accolyte (of Zavras: god of wizards and visions) Inete heard about our reputation for helping people
She besieges us to investigate the Aldani Basin
Johan asks what is specific about this basin
Inete has visions of red robed wizards in an hidden base somewhere in the basin
Elina recognises these as the red wizards of Thay
Grandfather Zitembe needs to approve of this quest
Inete wants to join the expedition, she'll provide her own food and supplies 100GP

# the harper basement
Nerissa leads James, Katisha, Filrene and Tissaia to a secret basement hq
She leads us to a room with 2 guards playing blackjack
James joins for 2 rounds and wins both
Soggy Wren finally enters, seemingly sloshed out of his mind
James sees through the act and calls him out on it, Wren ignores it completely
He asks the party to bring the amulet to his contact in the bathhouse: Diamsar
Filrene is asked to join the Harpers as they could use her stealth and subtelty
Filrene declined at this point, she first wants to survive this adventure
BingBong stole 2 rubies, but the party made him return them

# the bathhouse
Yuna and BingBong are left in a kennel
James, Katisha and Filrene get undressed and relax in the baths
they try to find Diamsar, but could not find him amongst the guests
Tissaia checked among the guards and found him
The two stepped into a private area to talk in peace
he asks about the amulet and that we should meet after closing
James has the amulet in his backpack
The group relaxes in the bathhouse and grab some food while waiting for Diamsar

# the Ytepka hideout
Diamsar checks the parts of the amulet and leads the party to an Ytepka safehouse called the northside market textile house
Diamsar is not amused by James' attempt at humour
The party enters the warehouse
Tissaia spots a snake and pulls a frown face
James remarks that if that is a problem, she should not venture into the jungle
Tissaia wants to find dragons and nothing will stop her
Diamsar lures James, Katisha and Tissaia in the middle of the room and opens a trap door, the three fall into it
snakes appear from holes and surround the party
Diamsar's allies crawl out of the woodwork
James tries to wallrun, but slips on the slick walls and falls on his neck and back, he's left dazed
Katisha vaporises a viper with her eldritch blast
after a harrowing fight, in which James was bitten by a snake in his snake (but everything was all right after some healing), they got the amulet back from Diamsar's corpse

In the back room, they found 2 prisoners, an elf and a tabaxi, who were used for experiments involving snake poison
the poison was injected by snakelike people
the poison made them feel incredible pain and made them hallucinate

The back door opened and several Yuan-Ti opened and Leketh (the leader) summoned the snake amulet to her hand
she thanked us for returning the amulet
at that moment Tree and Nerissa burst through the front door
