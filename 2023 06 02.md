# rescuing Tissaia

after defeating the remaining zombies, the party stealthily descended into the basement, giving chase to the monster that ate Tissaia
Elina is the first to descend and half falls to the floor, she casts light to get her bearings
Tissaia got up and ran towards the light Elina had cast
the gollum threw the table Tissaia who narrowly dodged it by dropping prone
the party engaged the ghouls in combat
during the fight, James got knocked out, but was helped by Elina
James was wounded during the fight in his face and his hand
Tissaia remembered that the creature is a flesh gollem and decided to look for clues in the room
she found a wizards desk and heard 3 voices in the back, one spoke with a strange accent, one was clearly undead and the last was out of this world
Tsavi tried to run away and climb back up the rope, but was pulled back into the room by an invisible force
this caused the rope to fall down
when Elina ran, the same force pulled her towards the three shadowy figures
revealing a fourth, prone figure between the them
meanwhile, the gollem picked James up by his head and flung him through the room towards the three shadowy figures
James investigated a pile of weapons and found a good set of ring mail and a good shortsword (+1)
Elina prayed to her god who gave her an enormous boon
after hearing the words of wisdom, she healed the unconscious woman who pulled Elina back towards the fire pit
Tissaia remembered the relic is a world key, a way to 
Morrigan, the unconscious woman, tells Elina that the three before them are trouble
the otherworldly entity is the king of darkness
the undead creature is the lich Assererack (ass is a rack)
the last one she calls the Barovia vampire lord
she explains that the vampire lord wants to escape the Shadowfell (dark dimension)
so he gave the wailing death curse to Assererack
The dark lord is licking his wounds after a serious defeat so he provides the minions to Assererack in exchange for a safe haven to rest

before the heroes can react, the lich turns into a fog and disappears
the dark lord disappears with a snap of his fingers
the vampire lord turned to face the party
James got a stake from a broken table and taunted the vampire to come closer
in response, the vampire summoned his pet dragon through the portal
Tsavi tried to push the pilar over to bring the roof down only to be helped by the vampire lord who crumbled the pilar with his telepathic powers
the flesh gollum roared, it startled creatures hiding in the ceiling who tumbled down and joined the fray
the dragon crawled through the portal and prepared to breathe fire
Morrigan told everybody to huddle together and cast a shield
Tissaia remembered a shield spell and protected everybody from the breath of the dragon
while the fire washed over the shield, Morrigan teleported the party away to unknown shores
