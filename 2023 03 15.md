# poisonous lakeside
after a short walk from the mangrove and a little rest and healing later, the party reached a rancid pool of knee deep water
after a short inspection, the party found a group of small reptilian creatures worshiping a statue
when Dahlin and Johan approached the altar the creatures were standing in front, they were mesmerised and charmed by the altar
Elina spotted a half moon metalic object oozing slime
Johan would have 3 weeks of nightmares about snakes and suffocating slime
Dahlin would only have a single week of nightmares

Elina tried to dispel the magic on the item, failed but was not charmed herself
Elina walked forward with her holy symbol held in front of her (and raised shield) and approached the temporarily disabled (dispelled) item
Ellis roared, charged forward and shapeshifted into a snake
a fight between the party and the reptilian creatures erupted

after the fight, we investigate the relic on the altar
the relic seems to be the cause of the poison in the water and the undead abominations
the grunks are not smart enough to get the relic on their own, it was probably given to them
Dahlin finds a letter on one of the corpses (while poisining herself), alas it is written in the Grunk native language

# back at Screaming Winds cottage
go back to screaming wind and tell what happened
wind theorises that the relic have an effect on the pterodactyl creatures that captured local villagers
show artefact to wind
wind wants to destroy it, but suggests to show it to soggy wren
we notice that the relic would fit together with the snakehead amulet that Sanuya gave us
together with the red gem it seems we have several pieces of an evil symbol

wind translates the letter after Dahlin gives it to her
the letter describes empowering the "gift" of the mother patron which should afterwards be delivered to a "prince"
Dahlin surmises that the "prince" could be one of the merchant princes

# returning to the Thundering Lizard inn
after consuming a meal with Wind, we return to the Thundering Lizard inn where we reside

Johan goes to chill in his room, cleaning his armour
some are chilling in the sauna
James and others are chilling in the common area
bought an addition to Volo's guide to monsters detailing what to eat and what not
Tsavi is warned not to go into the blue mist
the characters who remained at the inn learned several tidbits:
 - James learned that Chult is was the playground of a green dragon, if we reach Mezzroh, head east through the laughin gorge, then south towards kir 'sabal, you might stumble on the dragon bones and earn a place in the history books
 - don't eat lobsters
 - there are monsters in aldani basin
 - an airship called the Star Godess crashed somewhere in the jungle

the remaining group completed a quest from a master dyer who bought illegal substance to create colors
Omala (N male Chultan human commoner) is a master colorist at the dye works.
He recently bought some dancing monkey fruit on the black market and used them to make and sell dye.
Shortly thereafter, he received an iron token from the Ytepka Society—a grim warning.
He wishes to atone for his crime and seeks an audience with Kwayothé, the merchant prince who controls the legal sale of fruit.
Fearing for his life, Omala asks the adventurers to accompany him to Goldenthrone, where he plans to beg for Kwayothé’s forgiveness.
He has no money to offer the characters as a reward. Kwayothé is willing to forgive Omala’s lapse in judgment provided the heroesgree to kill a man named Shago within the next 10 days—no questions asked—and speak of the deed to no one.
Kwayothé tells them that Shago works as a guide out of Fort Beluarian. If the characters fail in this task, Kwayothé has
Omala sentenced to Executioner’s Run for his crime.
received 144 gp in advance

# Kwayothe's home
After a short night, the party wakes up early, grabs a light breakfast and prepares for the exquisite party at Kwayothe's house
