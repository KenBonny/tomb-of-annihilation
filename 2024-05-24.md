# Short story to move the story along

The heroes and their new bard friend finally breathed topside air again. After their long underground journey, they released a unanimous sigh of relief. After getting the whole team together at the inn, they learned of the Yuan-ti situation in the city and of the doppelganger, impersonating Tree, that lead them there, in the hopes they would have been dispatched easily. Luck was, however, on their side. Dashel explained that his team was one of three, all hired months ago, by Syndra Silvane. All teams went to gather information, and they would be led by famed adventurer Artus Cimber. After multiple outings into the jungle, many locations were visited and information gleaned.

Dashel’s team, upon arrival, went to Ataaz Muhahah, (“Laughing Gorge”), a gaping chasm crossed by an ancient stone span, called the Monkey Bridge. The structure got its name from the monkeys that perch on its walls and hang by their tails from its underside. The monkeys chatter and shriek continually, and the gorge echoes with the sound of their cries. Occasionally, the echoes from up and down the gorge overlap in a way that transforms the cacophony into haughty, gloating laughter. When that happens, the terrified monkeys fall silent for several minutes as the “laughter” dies away before resuming their chatter. During crossing, Dashel and friends ran into trouble, dealing with an animated stone statue. After their encounter they continued towards the Aldani Basin. The basin is named after the aldani, a race of lobsterfolk. Many Chultans recall childhood fables about the eerie lobsterfolk that lived in the rivers and lakes of their homeland. No reliable witnesses have reported an encounter with aldani in decades, so most Chultans believe the aldani perished. In truth, the lobsterfolk retreated to the secluded lakes of this basin, where they’ve kept hidden for a century. At first, it seemed like Dashel and his team uncovering the aldani would spell disaster, but they managed to keep the peace. The aldani treated with the team and showed them the path to reaching The Heart of Ubtao. A massive chunk of earth and rock, torn from the ground, drifts over the swampy forest, about two hundred feet above the ground. A petrified tree towers above the stone, with its roots protruding from the bottom. Between the shape of the rock and the branching of the tree’s limbs, it creates the impression of a gigantic stone heart hanging in the sky. The impression is only made more gruesome by the red liquid dripping from the roots (rainwater that was stained by filtering through iron ore deposits in the rock). Chultans who’ve seen the earthmote believe it’s actually the petrified heart of the god Ubtao, and they consider it sacred. Priests of Ubtao used to travel here on the backs of flying dinosaurs to seek visions inside the heart and to beseech Ubtao to return. There, it is where Dashel and team faced off with Valindra Shadowmantle, whom worked for Szass Tam, the most powerful lich among the Red Wizards of Thay. She found the heart and converted it into a base to use while her minions searched for the something called “the Soulmonger”. Her orders from Szass Tam were to seize control of the Soulmonger, if possible, or destroy it otherwise. Victorious against their foes, Dashel’s team returned to the city.

Team two went to Dungrunglung, where they had a run-in with grungs, toiling under the tyranny of their despotic king, Groak, who was obsessed with summoning the goddess Nangnang and mating with her. To please their king, the grungs had erected a 60-foot-tall mud shrine, where Groak planned to woo the goddess and where she, in turn, could bless him with generations of God-touched, royal Groaklings. They dealt with Groak and learned a lot from the grungs about the mischievous Trickster Gods of Chult. Then, they managed to finally secure a path to their true destination, the long-forgotten city of Omu. Omu lies in a basin hidden in the depths of the rainforest, surrounded on all sides by sheer cliffs. The city is notoriously hard to find. Those who try must contend with miles of trackless jungle inhabited by natural predators, cannibals, and the remnants of an undead army. Even skilled guides have difficulty threading their way through. Team two then returned to Port Nyanzaru with their task completed. Both groups combined their information, spoke with Syndra Sylvane and her harpers, and patiently awaited the return of the third team and Arthus, and also new orders. The truth they uncovered was horrifying. When Artus finally arrived, they reviewed everything together.

“Unknown to Syndra and her allies, the Soulmonger, an incredibly powerful relic, is trapping the souls of the dead and depriving liches of the means to trap souls in their phylacteries. (The Soulmonger snatches up the souls before they can be trapped elsewhere.) Szass Tam, has sent operatives, and his most devoted lieutenant, to Chult to steal the Soulmonger or destroy it. Though Valindra had been dealt with, the Red Wizards remained a threat. But the Soulmonger seemed to be also the cause of the Wailing Death curse, breaching, undoing and cancelling all restoration and resurrection magic, draining all souls from across the entire world. Also lurking in the heart of Chult is Ras Nsi, a mythic, villainous figure among Chultans. Ras Nsi was a human paladin and a sworn protector of the city of Mezro. He betrayed his oaths and was banished. Rather than redeem himself, he offered himself to a dark being, and raised an undead army to conquer Mezro. The would-be tyrant was defeated and banished once more. He withdrew to the city of Omu, leaving the vestiges of his undead army to roam unchecked throughout the jungle. That was not the end of Ras Nsi, however. Bitter, he forged an alliance with the yuan-ti lurking in the ruins of Omu and underwent a ritual of transformation, becoming a yuan-ti malison. As a yuan-ti, Ras Nsi imposed his terrible will on the evil snake people and became their leader, still following the guidance of his dark lord.” Days later, there was still no news of the third team. The second team left for the jungle again, to construct a base of operations from which to breach into Omu. Contact was lost shortly after. Artus and Dashel’s team went to the Underdark to find the Tower of Karthuun where a mighty relic was said to be hidden. This is where Dashel and team were ambushed by Valindra Shadowmantle again, who turned out to be a powerful lich herself. She left their remains to her goblin allies and went after Artus himself. He has not been seen ever since. The only person who might know of his whereabouts is luckily your own guide, Azaka, for she had been his guide during his own trips into the jungle.

Luckily, your team found what was left of Dashel’s group and the bard was in terrible shape. You bested the goblins and braved the Tower of Karthuun only to find it looted. No trace of Valindra or Artus nor the relic. You decided to go back topside and explain everything to Gale. The mage sighed at the abundance of information suddenly being spilled. The situation was dire. He had felt a presence of great darkness helming all of this. A presence that hasn’t been felt for quite a time. The Wailing Death’s evil architect might be —the archlich Acererak. Under normal circumstances, the enraged archlich would be far too great a foe for mortal adventurers to overcome, but with the trickster gods of Omu possibly on their side, the heroes might have a fighting chance. Gale upheld his part of the bargain and took from the heroes the relic they had pieced together: the dreamer amulet, to make sure it would be destroyed. It was in truth a ‘gift’ from none other but infiltrating yuan-ti, hoping to use it to mind control the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru, in a bid to wrest control over the city, kill as many as possible, and keep adventurers far from learning the truth. Beneath the cracked and broken streets of Omu lies a secret yuan-ti temple called the Fane of the Night Serpent, where Ras Nsi holds sway and plots to bring about the end of the world, in the name of his lord Acerarak. Your team now knows what they are up against. A grim fate awaits.
