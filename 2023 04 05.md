# update Lady Sylvane on the progress
Filrene's night out with Bugdurash
James will sleep in
Tissaia will help volo
Filrene and Tsavi goes to the baths
Johan and Ellis go supply shopping
Dahlin and Elina will report to Lady Sylvane

it's 65 degrees F (18 degreec C)
no wind
heavy rain (no tropical storm)

Dahlin and Elina buy umbrellas on their way to the mansion of Lady Sylvane
guards give friendly welcome, nobody asks for papers and guides them in the direction they need to go
Rindawan asks in broken common if they are acquantances of Lady Sylvane
asks for legitimation/id > show letter from Lady Sylvane
master Otamu is unavailable, but they are welcome in the mansion

they are led to a room with 6 locals, one of which is the Aazon
four are seated around a conference table, the flunkies of other princes (based on the presense of Aazon)
The last two are Otamu and his concubine, who are following the conversation from his personal desk
Otamu is a dandy who is easily seduced by smart women or that is an carefully created persona
Otamu is a friend of the Harpers and allows them to use his mansion as a base of operations
the 4 flunkies could be agents of the Harpers sent to the other princes to spy on them and keep them in line

Otamu asks what they want to do about the curse
tell him about the slime and the snakehead amulet
we are welcome in the mansion and can get magic items at a discount, in return we share information with him
they show the amulet to Otamu
he takes the amulet with magical, silken protective gloves
he uses several tools to inspect the amulet more closely
he tells Dahlin and Elina that there is a foul aura surrounding the amulet
need to contact Soggy Wren to investigate further
gives the amulet back so the party can guard it

Syndra Sylvane appears behind them
Elina goes for a cuddle, but Sylvane stops her
the smell of death and decay surrounds her, she is too brittle to endure the cuddle

Dahlin and Elina recap the story to Lady Sylvane

Alaster Bol sent a message to investigate missing workers
Lady Sylvane suggests hiring a guide via Alaster Bol
- Cupla Lowe
- Azaka Stormfang
- Gondolo
- 
we can buy malaria medicine
we have provisions
we still need pack animals
Lady Sylvane grants us a pair of [Communication Pendants](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=1463) so the two party groups can stay in contact like a cellphone

Otamu gives coupon for 50% off of potions in the market ward

# buying animals
Johan and Ellis go to the grand sook to buy supplies
Johan feels like he's being followed, he keeps looking back to spot familiar faces
Johan spots a hooded figure who disappears into an alley
by the time Johan is at the alley, the figure is gone, but he has left a piece of his purple cloak with a single scale in it

a man sized shadow waves at Ellis and yells: get over here quickly, I caught one
Ellis points this out to Johan
Ellis checks it out carefully
it appears to be a white fish merchant who speaks fluent common

Ellis goes to purchase pack animals
she chooses 2 animals who she (as druid) can feel long to roam the jungle again
a hadrosaurus named Timmy and a lizard named Bob

# acquiring a guide
after a lot of handwaving and showing the letter, the guads let Ellis and Dahlin inside to meet Alaster Bol
he is a big, sweaty guy with sweat stains
he complains a lot and wants something exciting to happen
hates his advice to be ignored
Ellis explains that they want to hire Azaka Stormfang as guide in return for a favor that a problem 
in the old city, people have been disappearing in the dead of night and turning undead
Alaster send Deerio to investigage, but the guy has not resolved
if we find Deerio and stop the zombies in the city, he'll lend the guide and sponsor the expedition further
talk to the people in the area to find out more
