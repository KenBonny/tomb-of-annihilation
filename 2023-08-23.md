## fighting the necromancer
Nerissa is friendly and helping us
not sure why she is here
James ran to Volpo and tried to slash him
Volpo used a magic shield to block the attack
Tsavi ran behind James and stood behind him on the planks
She threw an acid splash, but missed everybody
Volpo summoned a spectral dagger and tried to stab James
who lunged forward, skewering Volpo on his sword

the whole crew was busy fighting the zombies
after a few moments, the corpse on the table jerked to life
Volpo reincarnated himself
James tried to sneak behind Volpo again while his mates took care of the zombies
Unfortunately, Volpo heard him coming and threw the cage that previously contained Deerio towards James
who deftly jumped out of the way
He bounded up the cage back onto the platform and drove Volpo into a corner
His allies dispatched of the zombies and helped corner Volpo
Elina silenced him
James tried to free Deerio from the grasp of the undead Volpo who had a grip on his throat
Unfortunately he failed and was forced back towards the table where Volpo zombie came from
so he prepared to snatch him from the grasp of the zombie
Tsavi searched the notes of the necromancer and found a letter detailing that the amulet near it called to him to use necromancy to gain more knowledge
Tsavi picked up the amulet, nothing happened
Volpo cast a spell trying to switch his soul with Deerio's
Elina helped Deerio's soul to enter his own body again
doing that triggered a great force explosion
James was thrown back on the same table the Volpo rose from
Volpo targetted James to swap souls, he started fighting for his life
Tissaia and Tsavi were thrown off the platform by the force
Tsavi ran back to help out
James fought with all his might to repel the invading spirit and succeeded for the moment
Nerissa, who had escorted the other victims, now came back to help and saw the desperate situation
Elina drove her magical spear weapon through the zombie occupied by Volpo
Unfortunately this did not stop the onslaught on James' soul
James felt Elina's devine help which gave him renewed strength to keep holding on
Meanwhile Tsavi investigated the amulet and discovered that it was the missing piece of the snake amulet we won during the arena games
She then rushed towards the original corpse of Volpo to see if there is anything that can help
Tissaia stood helpless by
As neither soul could find dominance over James' corporeal form, a being from beyond snatched Volpos soul into an abyss beyond his comprehension
As James' soul watched Volpo being snatched away, he knew this is the cause behind the death curse and the reason none can be resurrected
