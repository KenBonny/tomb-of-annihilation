## saving the city
Johan, Dahlin, Filrene and Ellis returned to the bridge towards the city during a hot (35degrees), heavy rainfall afternoon
the city is burning in the background
after a short huddle, we decide to tell the guards that we defeated the dragon and we will give more details to prince Ifan
we can bluff our way out when Ifan is unhappy by threatening to tell everybody he wanted the dragons egg, thus endangering the entire city

Dahlin talked to the guards and convinced them (deception nat 20 + 8) that we saved everybody and their grandchildren, the guards will spread the word of our heroic deeds throughout the city
they gave us 6g 1s compentation

we return to the house of prince Ifan where his wife is showering us with compliments
he asks after the dragon trophy, we told him we chased the dragon away
he asks after the dragon egg, we told him we returned it to the dragon
Filrene threathened to expose why he wanted the egg
it worked (intimidation nat 20 + 2) and he is pissed that he isn't getting anything
we argued that he, with the dragon tooth, is the only one in the city with proof that he did anything to stop the creature, thus gaining a lot of standing in the city
he thought he got cheated, called it break even and told us to leave and never return


## returning home
James, Tsavi, Elina and Tissaia came out of the portal under the zigurat where they encountered the zombies and the three evil people.
the escaping dragon cause the cave and temple ruins to partially collapse
the party climbed up using ladders that were there to the top of the cave
we started clearing rocks blocking the way out
James hit himself in the face with the crowbar clearing a stone
Tsavi dropped it on her foot before rolling way
Tissaia almost fell when she used her mage hand to move several rocks, James caught her in time
one by one we crawl through a small opening in the rubble
Tsavi hears voices further along in the tunnel and lets us know
we all silently make our way closer
a chasm with a rickety walkway across
James did a heroic jump across and landed as silently as a cat
Tissaia tried to cross the chasm, the planks crumbled beneath her
with a quick reaction and a lucky cast, she was just in time to cast shield to protect her from the worst of the impact
Elina tried to grab her, but was too late
Tsavi tried clearing the chasm by jumping, but her foot slipped in the push off
luckily, James was prepared and caught her wrist, let himself fall backwards, planted his shin in her stomach and used her momentum to thow Tsavi behind her against the wall
that maneuver saved Tsavi's life, but cause a hell of a ruccus
Tissaia climbed out of the pit she fell in
Tissaia and Elina cross the chasm with a good jump
at the end of the tunnel, James stealthed to a hidden spot where he could survey the room in front of him
he noticed 3 captives next to him, chanined to the wall, he noticed piles of corpses and a sorcerer/neromancer busy casting a spell
Tsavi and Tissaia snuck closer
Tissaia recognised the spell as the [raise dead](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:raise-dead) spell
Elina summoned a magical spear to fight beside her, then she snuck closer
the party decided that the guy is evil and should die, they took this decision based on the raise dead spell he was casting, thus eliminating the undead threat
James snuck behind the guy (3 really good rolls) and tried to assassinate him, but a last minute reflection of light in his blade notified Volpo of an attack and he cast shield to deflect the attack
with his mage hand, he flicked a switch under his desk and set the zombies in the cage on the other side free
then he fled away from Tsavi and James without checking his safety
Tsavi missed her attack of opportunity, but James skewered him good
heavily wounded, but at a safe distance, he asked who we were and why we are there
the zombies shamled towards Tissaia and Ellis
At that moment, the elevator sprang to life and Nerissa came down
she surveyed the scene and prepared for a fight
