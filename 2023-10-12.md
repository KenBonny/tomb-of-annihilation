# The assassination - part 2

we search the guards, two children pass by the window
Filrene puts the fingers of the sleeping guards in water
James spots the next guard standing guard and Filrene shot him through the bars that were separating him from James
James then walked up to the door and locked the other doors to the cantina
everybody gathers around the sleeping guard
James listens to the door at the other side of the hallway
Filrene readies his crossbow and keeps it trailed on the hallway
Katisha joins the rear and is surprised when a little Bing Bong (demon companion) appears
Bing Bong asks what he should do (in infernal)
Katisha tells him to be quiet
Filrene looks back distrusingly as the creature floats upwards and motions Filrene 
James is slightly surprised and motions them both to 
The first room is empty and together with Ellis, James puts the sleeping guard in the empty room
as James put another guard to sleep, the other guard at the end of the hallway turns around and notices James
James recognises the guard as the target they need to assassinate

James: I think you know why we are here
Shogo: fuck... how much did they pay you?
James: Enough. You must have done something big
Shogo: what if I offered you...

Filrene crept up to the corner, stepped out and shot a sleep arrow into the knee of Shogo
we dragged him near the other guard and discussed what to do with this situation

Katisha was looking through the rooms to the side of the corridor
she found the documents with the details of the deeds of the gnolls actions (raped and killed his owners)
she found out the the orcs are innocent

Katisha convinced James to release the innocent orcs as there is enough prejudice against orc kind
they graciously carry the unconcious Shogo outside
we offer the orcs jobs as caravan guards, which they begrudgingly accepted as they have no better options and because they owe a blood oath to James (and the party) for freeing them
they will hide out until we leave for the jungle
in the nearby cell, 2 other inmates notice dark figures attack the guards and free the orcs
the party did not notice these inmates

Filrene kills the guard that recognised her when she knocked him out
we disguised Shogo as a drunk and escorted him 
we want to interrogate him before we decide what to do with him
- what did he do to be a target?
- how come he speaks common?
