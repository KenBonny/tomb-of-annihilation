# Goblin camp
Johan walks up to the first goblin, shouts that they have captured their... not really friends but people they need to save
he calls in a divine favour and cleaves the closest goblin in two with a golden slash of godly power
all nearby goblins turn their heads
The goblin riding the frog tried to hit Johan, but glanced off his armour
Elina summoned a giant sabre and hit the rider
Ellis transformed into a bear
seeing the fighting sobered Dashel up... a little bit, not enough to enter the fight
the frog wrapped it's tongue around Johan and started squeezing the life out of Johan
Tsavi slashes at the frog rider and chops off his hand
Johan channels his gods divinity to become a peerless athlete and bursts out of the tongue hug
the slime of the tongue starts to corrode his armor
Elina throws radiant flame on one of the goblins in her sight
Ellis charges to the frog with rider and mauls and bites the frog
this irks the other goblins who start slashing Ellis in bear form
the frog turns to Ellis and misses his bite
Tsavi swings her axe and cleaves the head of the frog in twain
two more goblins rush in and attack Ellis in bear form
Johan runs around Ellis and attacks one of the goblins
Dashel wakes up out of her stupor caused by the fumes of the tent
Tree urges Dashel to move as the nearby goblins, frogs and snails start to move towards him
Elina misses her spell
Ellis bites the goblin again

Dashels runs to the barely conscious dwarf and asks about the death curse
the dwarf scolds Dashel to stop asking stupid questions and to help him
Dashel casts healing word and the dwarf regains consciousness
Tree frees the dwarf from his bonds
the goblins advance on Dashel and consorts

The fighting continues, blows are exchanged and spells are returned
Johan slices open the boss goblin's stomach
Elinas magic sword almost amputates the goblins leg
She runs towards Dashel and heals Dashel with healing word
Ellis as bear rips the smaller goblin to shreds and squishes his head between her paws

The globlins near Dashel notice Tree and throw all their attacks on him
Dashel, Tree and the dwarf run for their lives away from the small army of goblins and consorts

With a mighty blow, Tsavi decapitates the goblin chief whose head bounces all over the place
Johan ran towards Dashel to help them, noticed the other goblins and promptly launched a guiding bolt at the frog leading the charge who lit up like a christmas tree
