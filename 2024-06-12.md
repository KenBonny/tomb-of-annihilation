in the middle of the zoo stood her patron who offered the other gem in return for a gift of equal value
after asking what he wanted, he said he valued life
he accepted the fruit of the tree of Uptoa's nephew

after James and Katisha made their way back to the spiral staircase leading to the compound and out the archway they came in, they found themselves back with the rest of the party
Tissaia led them to the source of the magic aura
it appeared to be the head of a Gargoyle carved into a wall
after trying to use the gems to open a portal to the lych's lair, another portal opened and Valindra appeared
she demanded the gem, but James made it disappear with a sleight of hand magic trick
angred, she summoned a beholder ally and froze half the party in stasis
