# acquiring a guide
Dahlin and Eline continue to negotiate with Alaster Bol for a guide
Alaster sent Deerio to investigate the disappearance of citizens who reappear as zombies
Alaster does not know what happened with Deerio

Dahlin and Elina leave to check out the neighbourhood in search of clues
Alaster gives Dahlin a signet ring to indicate you are working on order of the Order of the Gauntlet

the both make their way to Pockmarked Po and ask if he knows anything about the missing citizens and the dead that don't stay dead
Po notices the ring on Dahlins hand and asks if they work for the Order of the Gauntlet
Po cautions them who they should work with
he also tells them he saw a tavern patron who heard the "call of the dead"
once the patron heard it, he walked out muttering about death under his breath

this smells like foul magic

Po knows Deerio as an annoying clergyman who was also looking into the disappearances
he disappeared near the biggest ziggurat that faces the executioners run (place in Chult)

# interlude towards the slums

after a nice evening of laughing, eating and planning
James, Tissaia, Tsavi and Elina pass by the market
James and Tsavi get a mint lassi drink
Tissaia gets a squid on a stick

they encounter a group of men displaying a pair of large, angry wolves who "will eat anybody who gets too close"
James pushes Tissaia a step or two closer to tease her

A group of men are standing near a temple, talking about an old town legend. The legend is about a dragon that is sleeping just outside the town’s walls. The storytellers look wealthy and affluent
James bumps into them, makes a grand appology and swipes a purse containing 33gp

A group of people are holding up a mirror, trying to catch a glimpse of something behind them
they are using the mirror to look into the window they are hiding under trying to spy on a fornicating couple
Elina yells that the perverts should stop peeping, the couple closes the blinds as the crowd disperses

A man has set up a stand selling candles. They’re very cheap, but he says they’re made from a special recipe that will keep the candle from ever burning down, even if it’s left in a hallway.
Tsavi calls bullshit
merchant is intimidated and gives one candle for free
the merchant gives her a short, stocky, black candle with purple glitters

# investigate ziggurat number 1

after arriving in old town, we march through the town towards the ziggurat
James notices several things:
- the ziggurat provides water for old town
- the two dragon statues next to the entrance look like they're part of a trap, unsure without further investigation
- the carvings above look like the snake from the amulet

Tsavi investigates for zombies, but finds none... yet

Elina searches for magic sources and finds a carving depicting human soldiers fighting snake people (Yuan-Ti)
she finds this fascinating that there were inhabitants before humans came to this island

Tissaia looks for historical information
She discovers it's very old and that it looks in pretty good condition for it's age

Elina checks the dragon statues for magic and finds a magical defence against intruders
trap is activated inside via a gem in the dragon statues mouth
with Tissaia's mage hand spell, James' fiddling with the trap and Elina's divine guidance, we gather that the trap is harmless after so many years

The closed door poses it's own problem
Tsavi tried bashing the door with her axe and intimidating it
James looked for a keyhole to pick and even pushed with all his might
Tissaia and Elina looked for a hidden button or loose tile conceiling an opening mechanism

# investigate ziggurat number 2

Elina detects a lot of magic in the air
James finds something toppled a marble pilar by gripping it, leaving finger imprints like you'd grab butter
Elina finds a depiction of an ancient king fighting a sort of sphinx
When the party enters the second room and are confronted with the carnage within, they all puke except James
He doesn't think anything will faze him anymore after the soap factory
James does not find any traps in the next room, but hears humanoids moving around
As Tsavi goes to investigate the sound, 3 zombies burst through the door
battle ensues
halfway through the fight, a huge zombie clawed it's way out of a hole in the ground
the new zombie was composed of parts of other zombies
the zombie grabbed Tissaia, shoved her into his mouth and dissappeared further into the lair
