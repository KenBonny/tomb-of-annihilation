# talking with Grandfather Zitembe
Johan, Tsavi, Elis and Elina arrive at the temple
it's warm, humid, there is no wind and no rain
Johan is sweating his ass off in his chainmail
Johan urges the party inside the cool, refreshing temple
inside of the temple it smells like sage, an assortment of races is busy in prayer
Grandfather Zitembe tells us about the people in the Aldani Basin
he asks for a monetary contribution to give his blessing for this quest
he tells us that Arctus Zimber raided the temple and damaged the altar
with a donation of 140 gold, the Grandfather is pleased and grants us with Zavras' blessing (lasts 4 days)


# Ytepka safehouse
after defeating Diamsar, the other party gathers near the door and the sickly looking hostages
Tissaia discovers that they are not suffering from the death curse
James and Filrene notice that they are Yuan-Ti broodlings, they are shedding their former skin and are transforming into Yuan-Ti
when we asked if they want help, the two can only grunt and gurgle puss and large amounts of saliva
Tree led us towards here and told us to trust them, Tree is acting weird
James locks the two victims and BingBong in the room
BingBong teleports through the door

we ask Tree, who is acting strange by guarding the door and speaking in a strange voice, to go and get help
partially in hopes he gets help, but also to get him out of the way

we stack up on the door
James hides near the door, Filrene and Nerissa hide further back in the room
A Yuan-Ti in fine clothes surrounded by 5 other hench-Yuan-Ti
The leader, Leketh, was pretty but in a grotesk way
after a short discussion, which went nowhere fast, we did learn that the amulet is sentient
a fight ensued where we killed most of her guards
Tree reappears when he stabs Nerissa in her side
the real Tree would never do this
James rushes over to help Nerissa and slashes him in his thigh
Tree turns to James and whispers that he is a traitor... to his family (his deepest secret/shame)
Nerissa overhears Tree say this and notices James' shocked reaction
