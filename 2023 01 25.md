# exploring the jungle

next morning, Johan, Elina, Ellis and Dahlin go to Screaming Wind
see SW fight off two winged creatures: pterafolk
Dahlin draws a picture for Volo's book
SW introduces herself as a member of the Emerald Enclave

follow her to her house
sickness in the jungle, diseased plants and threats from diseased creatures and undead
started 2 weeks ago, thinks it is related to the death curse
difficult to keep residents safe, pterafolk swoop in to abduct people/residents, rescue party disappeared

on the way to the location, we chased away a swarm of diseased Satabayi bugs
Johan spots Okuligbo Weed and recognises it as the same plants from the arena fight
they are halucinogenic

got to the scene, tried to free an elf woman who got dragged into the bushes by vines and subsequently killed
several twig and needle blight creatures appeared and attacked

freed Ashen Rock from plants after fight
Screaming Wind appeared with backup and other saved abductees
Johan used lay on hands to restore the abductees
this was not the end point, the heart of the problem lies deeper in the jungle: ~30minutes walk from encounter site
