James struggles to get his soul back into body, but does not succeed
Tsavi found some gold (20)
Tissaia rummaged through the drawers of Volpo's desk and found alchemists fire, a scroll of healing word and an ivory scroll case (possibly containing hidden items)
Elina asked her god to put James' soul back into his body, the god let her know that the binding spell is not complete
Nerissa checked up on Deerio, who was in shock after seeing the carnage of the last few days. A lack of sleep and no food did not help his condition
James' ethereal conscious calmed down and felt the pull of the spell keeping him here
he investigated the spell residu which looked like a rope
pulling it with his formless hands, biting it with his mystic teeth only proved that the spell is immune to his influence
Tsavi saw she could not help with the magic spell, so she investigated the room and noticed a door behind Deerio
James used his ethereal presence to walk through the door behind Deerio
he found a Thiefling girl chained to a wall
he noticed a bracelet beset with gems around her left wrist
he walked back through the big vault door and gestured that there is somebody behind the big door

Tsavi investigated the two tables near the wall, she found dynamite, a roll of fuse, tinder boxes, pickaxes, pittons, rope,... everything you'd need to work in a mine
a little further there's a canary in a cage, a living canary
she picked up 2 sticks of dynamite, the fuse and the tinder box

Elina found a scroll which she could read with her primordial language knowledge
She and Tissaia are discussing what to do with the scroll that described how to unbind the spell keeping James out of his body
unfortunately the words of power should not be used together as this is a dangerous combination of words

Nerissa went back to check Volpos original corpse again for a key to the vault door
In the inside of his belt, she found a key

Elina and Tissaia decided to use the spell to try and use the words of power to break the spell
with a bright flash of light James felt the spell break
he felt himself being pulled backwards into his body
he rolled from the table to his hands and knees and retched
in a fit of rage he drew his dagger and eviscerated his nearby zombie corpse
several stabs and curses later, he calmed down and got a grip
he thanked Elina and grabbed a handful of gold from his purse to donate 16g to her alms box she is holding out expectantly

after James calmed down, the others came closer and Nerissa wanted to open the door to the prisoner
James shouted to wait so he could first investigate for traps
after he was certain there were none, Nerissa opened the door
the prisoner introduced herself as Katisha the warlock
James unlocked her chains and Nerissa unlocked her magic blocking bracelet

the party returned to Allistar Bol who is in a very good mood and slapped Tsavi, who was closest to him, on her back
he handed over the gold reward of 90 gold pieces (60 reward + 10 for Allistar good mood + 20 for each rescued prisoner)
Nerissa whispers to Elina to keep the amulet hidden as it is an important part of the snake trinket, she'll take the party to the Harpers offices later
Nerissa says her goodbyes, flashes an intricate sign to Allistar and leaves

in front of the Thundering Lizard inn the party met the others
Johan thundered that he fought a dragon
James sighed that that would be a story to the 

James crawled upstairs, ditched his clothes, gear and backpack
after a long steaming bathtub he skipped dinner and collapsed on his bed into a fitful nights sleep

Johan put his gear into his room, albeit tired, but fired up from the events of the day
he went back down, helped eat all the food Ellis was ordering and drank pitcher after pitcher of beer
he boasted of his deeds fighting the dragon, with each beer the dragon grew a meter and breathed twice as much fire
the next morning, he woke up next to a gorgeous noblewoman (think Jennifer Lawrence)
unbeknownst to him, he sent the noblewoman pregnant back to her very darkskinned husband

Dahlin performed with the local troupe and was outstanding
she ended up in the room of both the lead singer and female violinist
she accepted the contract to tour with them

Tissaia ordered loads of food to cheer up Ellis who was in a sort of catatonic state

Tsavi and Katisha joined Tissaia and Ellis and socialised the night away
they exchanged stories

Filrene and Elina withdrew into the bath house after eating their fill
Filrene detailed her plans for building a gun/pistor/rifle, buying different parts with different vendors so they can't piece together what you are building
Elina talked about dying, being a giant and swimming in lava

They were the talk of the tavern and the guests of honour of the night


## the next two days
Filrene spent 200g, including 50g discount because we are friendly with several factions
Elina again went over all events she went through with Volo

Ellis meditates at the edge of the jungle, rehearsing spells
Tissaia went to the grand sook to sell the ivory scroll case (5g, she only got half)
in the afternoon they practiced spellcasting
afterwards they went window shopping for gear, potions

James and Johan spend the first day relaxing, cleaning their armour and sharpening their swords and catching eachother up on their experiences
on the second day, James stole a bouquet of flowers to hand to Bugdruga (the orc shopkeeper) with whom he spent the afternoon with
Bug had a good time, but James still wasn't fully recovered so he called it a night instead of going inside with Bug

Johan went and helped out with local temples, healing people wounded in the panic with the dragon

Tsavi spent the days relaxing, reading books, honing her martial skills
Dahlin packed her bags to leave with the performing troupe
Katisha settled into Dahlin's room
