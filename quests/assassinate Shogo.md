Omala recently bought some dancing monkey fruit on the black market and used them to make and sell dye.
Shortly thereafter, he received an iron token from the Ytepka Society—a grim warning.
He wishes to atone for his crime and seeks an audience with Kwayothé, the merchant prince who controls the legal sale of fruit.
Fearing for his life, Omala asks the adventurers to accompany him to Goldenthrone, where he plans to beg for Kwayothé’s forgiveness.
He has no money to offer the characters as a reward. Kwayothé is willing to forgive Omala’s lapse in judgment provided the heroesgree to kill a man named Shago within the next 10 days—no questions asked—and speak of the deed to no one.
Kwayothé tells them that Shago works as a guide out of Fort Beluarian. If the characters fail in this task, Kwayothé has

Fort Beluarian was located on the northern tip of Chult, northeast of Port Nyanzaru and near the eastern shore of the Bay of Chult. It received supply shipments from the nearby stretch of beach referred to as Beluarian Landing.

Fort Beluarian is run by 60 Flaming Fist. It's a busy and prosperous place—built on the exploitation of Chultan resources by colonizers. The culture in the fort is generally positive and busy. The Flaming Fist are getting rich. In the wake of the Amnian expulsion, they are the primary Sword Coast profiteer here (also being a major part of the Port Nyanzaru wall guards and holding control over the northern part of the jungle).

The Flaming Fist would hire out its mercenaries from the fort for the right price, provided the task was not evil. In the late 14th century DR, the outpost was home to a small assortment of rangers, wizards, clerics, and rogues and numerous fighters.

Everything being shipped in or out of the fort goes through Beluarian Landing, which is nothing more than a stretch of beach with a few log buildings above the tide line. Ships anchor a half-mile offshore, and people and supplies are ferried back and forth on rowboats. Six Flaming Fist guards defend this station; their chief duty is rowing the boats back and forth. In case of danger, they can barricade themselves inside the stoutest log building or row out to sea until whatever threatens them loses interest and wanders away.
