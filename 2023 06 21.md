wake up with a heath stroke in the middle of space
the remnants of a universe float around us, the end of everything
this will happen to our world if we don't stop the vampire lord
Morrigan teleported the elder red dragon to the middle of the jungle, but it's angry and going on a rampage towards Port Nyanzaru
when Morrigan was done explaining the situation, she starts chanting to open a portal so other heroes can help and turning the world key
Tissaia warns Ellis about the dragon in the jungle
Elina tries to tackle the world key, got threwn back and her spirit remained at the key
James kept looking around in disbilief to all the strange events taking place around him
Tissaia tried to help Elina, whose looked no worse for wear, except her eyes were completely white
Tsavi threw a makeshift hook from a rope and a crowbar up to a floating island
James climbed up only to find out it barely held his weight
up there, he found a strange tomb
Tissaia found a strange chariot (car) with powerful artifacts (laser gun and rifle) in the backseat
after finding it, the chupacabra opponent stepped onto the car, crushing it
with a mighty gaze, it paralised Tissaia (10 rounds)
Elina prayed to her god for help, Helm appeared and granted her wish
her mortal remains perished, but she possessed the statue, granting her immense strength and power
she used that power to attack one of the giant creatures
at that moment, Tissaia broke free of the gaze only to be eaten by the creature
one of the creatures broke through the line of Elina's defence and is right before Morrigan
it struck Morrigan, breaking her concentration
annoyed that his creatures cannot dispose of the puny adventurers, the vampire lord Stradh entered the battle, struggling for control with Morrigan over the world key
James jumped passed a huge chupacabra to reach Tissaia and grabbed a laser gun from her arms
with which he took a potshot at the creature
when all looked lost, an army of heroes turned up to balance the odds
