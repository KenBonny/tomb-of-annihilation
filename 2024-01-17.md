# Temple of Savras (Grandfather Zitembe)
Johan, Tsavi, Ellis, Elina and Tree are talking with the wizard Gale who requests to find a party of adventurers

# Find the Underdark entrance in the Refuse Pit
Gale escorts us through the city, to the garbage dump that is the Refuse Pit
He tells us the entrance to the underdark is somewhere in this dump, this is the closest he can get us
Tree immediately starts investigating a pile of poop
Johan talks to the local crane operator and asks where a big hole in the ground is
The dimwitted ogre (crane operator) tells that the hole is near big beasts with tentacles
Tsavi understood that the creature is an Otyugh that feeds on garbage
The party searches around the garbage heap
Johan and Tree are sweating and taking heat damage from the weather
Johan investigates some moving garbage and is thrown back a few metres as the Otyugh comes out of the garbage
Tree starts talking to the Otyugh, Tree needs to talk into babytalk so the creature understands, the creature answers via telepathy
After a few questions and some misunderstandings about what humans and the underdark is, it guides us to the entrance
After inspecting the crates and grate over the entrance, we open the entrance to the underdark without problems
With Gales help in the form of a feather fall spell and an amulet that lets us contact him for a return trip, we enter the underdark

# The underdark
## The chasm with spider webs
after we land safely into the underdark, after Johan remarks that he expected the spell to break halfway through
Elina casts the light spell, Tsavi and Tree light a torch to add extra light
Johan grabs his sword and shield and checks depth of the chasm, it's deep, deadly deep
The party start exploring the cave
Tree finds two enwebbed corpses containing some junk, they're not the party members we're looking for
using spider webs that hang across the chasm in front of them, the party crosses the unfathomably deep chasm
Johans shoe got stuck in the webbing, but the spider transformed Ellis brings it across so Johan is not left shoeless
Ellis asked one of the spiders (who made the webbing) if they saw an adventuring party
the spider answered that they saw humans in the company of screeching creatures
after further questioning, the spider gives more details about the screeching creatures
they appear to be goblins
the party continues on

## the goblin camp
after a while the party encounters a beautiful sight near a lake, with a waterfall, some mushroom trees and a bridge across a river that start in the lake
Johan takes charge and walk right into a bear trap right before the bridge
his metal boot saves his leg from getting mauled
with a flick of the opening mechanism, he frees himself from the trap
Tsavi runs across the bridge and keeps her balance on the bridge
Elina asks her flying elf Evolette to inspect the bridge
Evolette reports that the bridge is very run down and heavy characters (heavy armoured guys) need to keep their balance or fall in
Ellis, Elina and tree use a rock in the river to cross it
Tsavi and Johan jump across the bridge
Tsavi lands safely, but Johan lands right on top of a trap and they plummet 20 feet (took damage)
