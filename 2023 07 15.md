# fighting Stradh

from the portal appeared an army of elves, battle tested and battle ready
the elven priest healed everybody
Tsavi tried her new armour, flew several meters with her rocket boots
Stradh flew next to Tsavi and kicked her through a rock
Tsavi landed in a rock several meters away with broken ribs and a pierced lung
James then attacked the Scyte with his newfound gun, but he fired straight into it's torso and did minimal damage
One of the Chupacabras landed next to Tissaia and tried to grab her with his tongue but failed
Morrigan tried to turn the world key, but failed
The ogre (Bart) tried to hit the Scyte monster but missed
Tissaia tried to shoot and hit the Chupacabra, unfortunately she missed everything
The scyte on which James shot, bit him severely
Tsavi gave the suit control, which engaged the autopilot and attacked Stradh
After taking a beating that would make Iron Man proud, he flung Tsavi off the floating space island
James rolled under the Scyte, fired his gun upwards, opened up a massive wound on his belly that covered him in acid
The Scyte was holding his guts inside, the Ogre judo threw the rest of the Scyte towards Stradh
Stradh drew his swords, cut the Scyte in two to avoid being covered in the acid from the leaking Scyte
The ogre stepped over Tissaia to protect her from the Chupacabra
Tissaia shot with her rifle at the Chupacabra, right through the tongue which ripped off from the weight of the end
The leftover Scyte tried to tackle the ogre, he grabbed the ogre and started headbutting it
Stradh summoned a Balrog to fight by his side
James stripped off the last of his acid covered armor and watched it disintegrate
The ogre grabbed the Scyte and dove headfirst into a pit of lava
The balrog grabbed Morrigan with its whip and drew her towards his feet
Tissaia ran over to James to see if he's ok
After verifying that James was ok, just very naked and then took aim at the Balrog
Unfortunately she missed the Balrog, fortunately she missed Morrigan
The ogre wrestled with the Scyte, ripped one of his arms off and bit at his head
Stradh flies towards Morrigan and turns the keystone back
James took aim at the Balrogs hand and shot the whip out of his hand taking his thumb with him
this caused the a lot of the enemies to target James
The Chupacabra targetted James and mauled both his legs and torso
The orge and chupacabra are fighting eachother, the Chupacabra took the eye from the ogre and then rammed one horn into his conciousness, knocking him unconscious
The Balrog slew Morrigan with his sword, pinning her to the wall
Tissaia took aim at Chupacabra but missed due to stress
The Chupacabra reacted and bit Tissaia's ear off
at the sight of Morrigan taking a sword to the chest, they issued the command to protect the empress/heiress (trouble translating from elvish)
the promtly formed a protective circle around Morrigan
Tsavi's suit was reloaded, it catapulted her towards the Balrog
She landed through the Balrog, decapitating it
It cost her her ribs (all broken), her spine (broken), she puked in the helmet from the pain
James flees towards the heroes, evades the zombies and asks the healer (Presto) for healing
Tsavis suit releases a swarm of healing nanobots that heal Tsavi and knit her bones back together
Stradh killed the remaining elves guarding Morrigan and ordered the Chupacabra to destroy the world key
James got healing and cleared a path for the healer to get to Morrigan
The ogre woke up and ripped the Scyte out of its body
Tissaia takes aim at the arm of the Chupacabra and blows it clean off
The gravely wounded heroes fled back through the portal
Tsavi used her suit to catapult herself and Stradh into the sky
only Stradh came back down as a cloud of black gas and posessed Morrigan
James looked around and noticed that there is nothing besides what he could see, no sun, no moon, no stars, no universe, just a little island surrounded by nothing
Stradh's mist pukes up the remains of Tsavi as a formless fleshblob
James notices the lifeless of Elina at his feet
James fires several shots at the mist that is Stradh, they pass harmless through him
the ogre gets a sign from his god Helm that guides him out of the lava
Tissaia shot the blob with her rifle and shot a hole in the middle of it
Stradh morphed into a shadow dragon as this is the true form of Morrigan
James, undecided, readied to shoot the first thing that tried to interfere with the turning of the world key
The ogre emerged from the lava with the help of his fairy guide
Seeing the altered battlefield, he cast silence on Stradh
the blue mage (now Kelly) managed to turn the world key into the third position
the green cleric, now out of spells, took his robes in hand and fled back through the portal he came in
out of ideas, Tissaia took a play from James' playbook and readied a shot
Stradh breath a cone of shadow fire from his dragon mouth
James dove out of the way of the fire breath behind a rock
the blue mage created a shield protecting herself and Tissaia
at that point, the paladin and ranger hero emerged healed and rested from the earlier battle
the paladin rushed forward and threw a healing potion towards James who deftly caught the potion
the ranger ran forward and readied a shot
Tissaia took aim over the shoulder of the blue mage and took a blind shot towards where she thought the dragon's head was
By sheer luck, the shot hit the dragon right in the beak
The ogres protecting Stradh ran forward toward the paladin and took on threatening poses
meanwhile, Stradh dispelled the silent bubble he was caught in
James drank the health potion and snuck around the rock to take aim at the nearest ogre
he blew a hole right through his torso but caused the gun to jam
The evil ogre tried to keep his guts inside, to no avail and dropped dead
The good ogre took a car lying around and hit the dragon over the head with it
now that the dragon is not breathing shadow flame on the mages, the blue mage abandoned her shield to try to turn the world key a last time
the paladin tried to stab the other evil ogre but failed
the ranger put an arrow through it's eye
But Tissaia put a hole through its stomach with her laser rifle
Stradh transforms back into a dragon
James manages to unjam his laser gun
more heroes emerged from the portal
the good ogre took the car again to smash it over the dragons head, but the dragon cubed the car to prevent this attack
the blue mage attuned the world key again
the paladin slashed at the remaining evil ogre again and again failed to land a hit
the ranger took out the other eye of the evil ogre
Tissaia retreated behind the huge rock and joined the ranger there
Then she blew out the evil ogres knee with her laser rifle
the new army that arrived through the portal surrounded the dragon
James shot the remaining evil ogre
the blue mage clicked the world key into the fourth position
the good ogre jumped onto the dragons back and started to choke it out
this forced Stradh back into mist form
beset on all sides, gave Morrigan the advantage she needed to break free from Stradhs hold
together with the blue mage, she managed to banish Stradh back to his own realm
The world key split into two pieces and faded away
James and Tissaia put their depleted weapons near where the portal key was
James used his genie book with the wish "I wish that my party will be restored to its full glory as it was when we first entered this forsaken realm where we keep all of our memories of this fight"
