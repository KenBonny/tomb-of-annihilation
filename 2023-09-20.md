# the assassination
James, Filrene, Ellis and the newbie Katisha gather to assassinate Shogo
we explained to Katisha that we need to assassinate a guy to save somebody else's life
Katisha is going along as a tryout to see if she fits in the team
James and Filrene coat their weapons (small dagger and 20 arrows) in Drow poison that makes the enemies fall asleep
the team sneaks into a guard tower and puts one guard to sleep
Ellis transformed into a cat so she could scout and move unseen
Ellis moves to distract the guard inside the office
the guard moves towards the window to shoo the cat away
at that moment James steps into the room and pokes the guard with his poisoned dagger so that she falls asleep instantly
Katisha goes and loots the desk and finds a set of keys
Ellis casts pass without trace on the entire party to help them stealth around
with the keys, stealth and drow poison the party puts every guard in the courtyard, the eastern hallway and the armory to sleep
